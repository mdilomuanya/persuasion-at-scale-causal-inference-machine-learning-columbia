# Persuasion at Scale: Causal Inference, Machine Learning, and Evidence-Based Understanding of the Information Environment (Columbia University)
This repository contains my coursework from Persuasion at Scale: Causal Inference, Machine Learning, and Evidence-Based Understanding of the Information Environment (Columbia University). I earned an A in the class, which was co-taught by professors from Political Science and Applied Mathematics, blending social science theory with advanced data analysis techniques.

Key Skills and Tools Learned:
- Causal Inference Methods:
- Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
- Natural experiments (Instrumental Variables, Difference-in-Differences, Regression Discontinuity)
- Observational and survey-based causal designs
- Applied Statistics & Econometrics: regression modeling, hypothesis testing, and bias detection.
- Machine Learning Applications: contextual bandits, reinforcement learning, A/B testing, and policy optimization.
- Data Science Workflow: cleaning, organizing, and analyzing real-world datasets (e.g., political behavior, media exposure, and social media activity).
- Experiment Design: pre-registration, hypothesis formulation, simulation of treatment effects, and validity checks.
- Generative AI & Persuasion: critical analysis of how AI-generated content (e.g., propaganda or ads) shifts public opinion and its ethical implications.
- Communication & Research Translation: translating technical findings into insights for policymaking, marketing, and media strategy.

Highlights from this Repository:
- Instrumental Variable Analysis: isolating exogenous variation (e.g., blackout shock) to estimate the causal effect of social media use on voting.
- Bandit Simulation Notebook: applied contextual bandits to explore personalized optimization strategies for persuasion.
- Generative AI Analysis: exploring how AI-driven media content can alter public beliefs at scale.
- Homework Projects: hands-on causal inference with Python (Colab/Jupyter), applying theory to simulated and real-world persuasion data.

This body of work demonstrates proficiency in causal inference, applied machine learning, and quantitative social science researchâ€”core skills for roles in data analytics, strategy, and policy evaluation.
